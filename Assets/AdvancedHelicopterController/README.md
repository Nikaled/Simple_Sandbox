# Advanced helicopter controller

Personal project I've been picking up from time to time. 

I still need to clean/document some portions of the code, polish the configuration parameters and tweak a few features but it is fully functional and pretty close from the first deliverable version. 

The goal is to create a Unity Asset out of this. 

Please note that any reuse of this code is strickly forbidden.
